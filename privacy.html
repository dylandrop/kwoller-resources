        </p><p>At Kwoller, we are committed to respecting your policy and understand that your privacy is an important part of the trust you place in us. This Privacy Policy ("Policy") describes how Kwoller, Inc. and its subsidiaries and affiliated companies (“Kwoller”, “we” or “our”) may collect, use and disclose personal information of our customers. This privacy policy applies to the Kwoller mobile App (“App”) and related site (“Site”) and services (collectively, the "App"). This Policy does not apply to websites, applications or services that display or link to different privacy statements.
        </p><p>INFORMATION COLLECTED
        </p><p>When you visit our site or use our App, we collect information from and about you in various ways. For example, we collect your name, email address, postal address, phone number, demographic information, preference information and and other information you provide us on our App. We may also obtain information from other sources and combine that with information we collect on our App.
        </p><p>We also collect credit card numbers if you purchase services on our app or use services that reconcile your credit card charges. We may also obtain information from other sources and combine that with information we collect on our App. The App may store credit card information, numbers, codes, passwords and other forms of payment information locally on your phone and on your account when you provide your payment details and when you purchase products and services from third party retailers and directly from Kwoller merchandise (collectively, “Retailers”) using our App. 
        </p><p>If you create a Kwoller account using, or otherwise connect your Kwoller account to, a social networking site, such as via your Facebook account, or you share items and post items via Kwoller’s share feature through such services, including, but not limited to, Twitter, Pinterest, and email services, we will also collect information provided to us by such social networking sites and mediums including for example your: name; email address; phone number; address; age; interests; list of friends; other demographic information; and any information you have made public on your Facebook as well as other accounts utilized.  </p><p>You also may give us permission to access your information in other services – for example, you may link your Facebook or Twitter account to Pinterest, which allows us to obtain information from those accounts (e.g., your friends or contacts).
        </p><p>When you use our App or visit our site, we may collect information about your usage through your device. For example, when you use our App or site, your device’s operating system, Internet Protocol (IP) address, App software, browser type, browser language, unique identifier, access duration and access times may be logged automatically.
