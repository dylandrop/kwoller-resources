There is no judge or jury in arbitration.  Arbitration procedures are simpler and more limited than rules applicable in court and review by a court is limited.  YOU AND KWOLLER AGREE THAT ANY SUCH ARBITRATION SHALL BE CONDUCTED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT IN A CLASS, CONSOLIDATED OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.  Notwithstanding any provision in these terms to the contrary, if the class-action waiver in the prior sentence is deemed invalid or unenforceable, however, neither you nor we are entitled to arbitration.

Notwithstanding any provision in these terms to the contrary, we agree that if Kwoller makes any future change to this dispute resolution provision, it will not apply to any individual claim(s) that you had already provided notice of to Kwoller.  Information on AAA and how to start arbitration can be found at www.adr.org or by calling 800-778-7879. If the arbitration in this section provision is found unenforceable or to not apply for a given dispute, then the proceeding  must be brought exclusively in a court of competent jurisdiction in New York, New York.  The Services and these terms and conditions are governed by the laws of the State of New York without regard to conflict of law provisions, using the English language in accordance with the Arbitration Rules and Procedures of AAA then in effect, by one commercial arbitrator with substantial experience in resolving intellectual property and commercial contract disputes, who shall be selected from the appropriate list of AAA arbitrators in accordance with the Arbitration Rules and Procedures of AAA. The failure of either party to exercise in any respect any right provided for herein shall not be deemed a waiver of any further rights hereunder. Kwoller shall not be liable for any failure to perform its obligations hereunder where such failure results from any cause beyond Kwoller’s reasonable control, including, without limitation, mechanical, electronic or communications failure or degradation. If any provision of these Terms is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that these Terms shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable. These Terms are not assignable, transferable or sublicensable by you except with Kwoller’s prior written consent. Kwoller may transfer, assign or delegate these Terms and its rights and obligations without consent. Both parties agree that these Terms, together with the Privacy Policy, Copyright Policy and any other operating guidelines, rules, documentation, policies and procedures posted through the Services comprise the complete and exclusive statement of the mutual understanding of the parties and supersede and cancel all previous written and oral agreements, communications and other understandings relating to the subject matter of these Terms. No agency, partnership, joint venture, or employment is created as a result of these Terms and you do not have any authority of any kind to bind Kwoller in any respect whatsoever.
